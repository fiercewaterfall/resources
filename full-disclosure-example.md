The following is an example of full disclosure communication between one or more partners at the start of a relationship or before they embark on any sexual activities.

---

Hello Jane,

As you read: By sending this to you I am mindful to say there is absolutely no pressure or expectation for any physical activities. Some might look at this as some sort of contract - I prefer to view as the start of a careful, purposeful and intentional conversation.

## Partners

All partners understand and agree on the issues outlined in this document, follow the same path / regimen, discuss regularly and are fully transparent with one another when considering new or potential partners.

## Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Screening

I test every three months (except hepatitis which is annual) at a local clinic the history of which is below. Depending on who you ask, this cadence is either:

* Too much: It seems medical professionals seem to recommend annual testing.
* Too little: Sex positive activists seem to recommend monthly testing.
* Both agree the more partners you have the more often you might need to test.

Every three months seems to be a balance where most infections can be caught fairly early taking into account the incubation period.

It should be noted the partner(s) of one person is also the partner of all persons. Therefore, we ask all partners to test regularly and share their most recent, written results. We have this exact conversation with all partners and ask them to do the same with their partners. Communication is perhaps the best prevention there is when it comes to communicable infections and diseases.

All that said: this is still a conversation about playing the percentages, risk mitigation and trust.

## Safer Sex

Recognizing the only safe sex is no contact at all, these are my starting points for discussion.

* Condoms for vaginal or anal penetration.
* Barrier free for oral activities.
* I am always comfortable with more protection (for example, condom or dental dam for oral) if that is preferred or required by a partner.
* I am non-fertile having had a [vasectomy or tubal ligation].
* Male ejaculation other than in condom (for example, a partner likes to have ejaculation occur on his/her body) is prearranged with consent.

## Consent

This short video is the best I've found thus far to explain how consent should work: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZwvrxVavnQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZwvrxVavnQ)

Generally speaking, I always ask before embarking on an activity - clothes on or off. For example:

* I will ask to hold your hand.
* I will ask to kiss you.
* I will ask to touch your shoulder.
* ...and so on.

Once consent is given it is generally agreed the consent for that specific activity is present from that point forward unless you prefer another approach or a kink requires a different method.

**Consent can always be revoked at any time, for any single or all activities.**

By default, no means no. Always.

Only if a set of safe words (or hand signals) for comfort and stop are defined and mutually agreed upon can the word 'no' be set aside. Generally speaking, this typically applies to dominant / submissive, power exchange, impact play and / or BDSM scenarios and will be covered separately if desired.

The most important thing for consent is communication with a preference for listening.

In summary: Assume there is no consent until you have asked and it has been clearly granted.

## Boundaries

**Boundaries** are scenarios which you know make you psychologically uncomfortable or triggers one or more of the senses (touch, taste, smell, visual, audible) in an unpleasant manner.

* Boundaries can be soft: "Be careful doing [this] because my [that] is extra sensitive."
* Boundaries can be hard: "Don't touch my [that]. Ever."

**Pop Up Boundaries** are the same as boundaries - you just don't know you have them because you've never experienced. Giving voice to these (and listening for them) as they occur helps to keep all involved in a safe, comfortable and happy place.

All individuals should use straightforward words to convey feelings and comfort at all times. All individuals should pay attention to body language and check in regularly to ensure a positive environment where fun and pleasure is center stage.

Soft boundaries for me: Deodorant / soap / shampoo / conditioner is absolutely good - love playing in or right after a shower or bath. Light perfume: Usually OK. Lots of perfume: Not so much. I have no fragrancy allergies - I simply prefer the taste and smell of the individual.

Hard boundaries for me: Urine, feces, blood, knife and needle play are strictly off the table. I make no value judgment on those who enjoy these delicacies - just not my thing. Note: Does not include menstrual blood and I note playing in warm showers are awesome in the midst of that season.

## Discretion

If we meet your friends / colleagues unexpectedly in public places I will introduce myself with "Hi, I'm [name]" and a nice handshake and let you take point on defining our friendship. I expect the same from you if we meet my friends or professional contacts.

I am totally fine for partners to verbally disclose details to their close friends and family -- emphasis on 'close'. People should always be allowed to tell their own story. Outing an individual's sexuality and sexual choices without their consent is highly objectionable.

Handholding, hugging and simple kissing in public is totally fine with me without prior consent. I do NOT assume the same is true of you unless we have a specific discussion and consent is given. More intimate public displays of affection can be expressed after conversation and consent.

I will always respect and advocate for privacy, yours and mine and by doing so there is no shame implied - simply respectful.

The rules on discretion change slightly in sex positive, clothing optional, adults only environments - but we will have a separate conversation on those venues should you ever decide you want to visit.

Yours,

John Doe
